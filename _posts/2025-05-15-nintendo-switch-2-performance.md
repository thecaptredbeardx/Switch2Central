## üöÄ Benchmark Comparisons

### üîπ GPU Performance

- **Switch 2 (Docked)**: ~2.4 TFLOPS (with DLSS 3.1 enabled)
- **Steam Deck**: ~1.6 TFLOPS
- **Xbox Series S**: ~4 TFLOPS

With DLSS, Switch 2 **renders internally at 720‚Äì900p** and upscales to 1080p/4K with frame reconstruction, allowing **higher perceived fidelity at lower native load**.

### üîπ CPU Performance

- 3x faster single-thread speeds vs original Switch
- Multicore utilization improved in **load-heavy titles** like *Metroid Prime 4* and *Zelda: Echoes of Time*
- New thermal design allows **consistent clock rates docked or handheld**

## üéÆ Real-World Game Performance

### **Zelda: Echoes of Time**
- Native: 900p ‚Üí DLSS 4K (docked)
- Frame Rate: 60fps (stable in most zones)
- Loading time: ~3.5 seconds (vs 12s on Switch 1)

### **Metroid Prime 4**
- Uses ray-traced lighting and reflections
- Runs at locked 1080p 60fps (DLSS active)
- HDR is natively supported in cutscenes

### **Mario Kart World**
- 1080p 120Hz (handheld & docked)
- Lag-free online with low input latency due to upgraded Wi-Fi 6

### **Hogwarts Legacy: Enhanced**
- Switch 2 version performs ~85% of PS5 settings
- Load screens reduced to <5 seconds

## ‚öôÔ∏è Loading Speeds: UFS 3.1 vs eMMC

Compared to the original Switch‚Äôs eMMC storage, the UFS 3.1 in Switch 2 is:

- üîº **4x faster read/write**
- üîÑ Cuts loading times in *Tears of the Kingdom* by over 60%
- ‚úÖ Supports seamless fast-travel and save-state recovery

## üé® Visual Upgrades

- **DLSS 3.1** allows dynamic resolution scaling
- **HDR** support improves contrast and color depth, especially on compatible TVs
- **Improved anti-aliasing** on docked mode compared to Switch 1 jaggies

## üß™ Emulation & Ported Titles

Switch 2 runs enhanced versions of Switch 1 titles with:

- Better frame pacing
- Improved draw distance
- Faster load-in of textures and environments

Titles like *Super Mario Odyssey*, *Luigi‚Äôs Mansion 3*, and *Tears of the Kingdom* benefit with **zero developer-side patching** due to system-level optimization.

## üîã Battery Efficiency

Thanks to Nvidia‚Äôs Ampere architecture and DLSS handling, the Switch 2 balances performance with battery better than Steam Deck or even the OLED Switch.

| Game                     | Battery Life (Handheld) |
|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| Zelda: Echoes of Time    | ~6.5 hours              |
| Mario Kart World         | ~8.5 hours              |
| Metroid Prime 4          | ~6.0 hours              |
| Indies (2D/Pixel)        | ~10+ hours              |

## üñ•Ô∏è Docked Mode Enhancements

While docked, the Switch 2 unlocks higher GPU clocks and voltage:

- 4K upscaling via DLSS
- Enhanced texture filtering
- USB 3.2 ports for external drives, wired LAN, and capture cards

## üìä How It Compares to Other Devices

| Device           | GPU (Approx) | Display          | OS        | Battery Life |
|------------------|--------------|------------------|-----------|---------------|
| Switch 2         | ~2.4 TFLOPS  | 7.9‚Äù LCD, 1080p   | Custom OS | 6‚Äì10 hrs      |
| Steam Deck       | ~1.6 TFLOPS  | 7‚Äù LCD, 800p      | Linux     | 2‚Äì7 hrs       |
| PS5              | 10.3 TFLOPS  | N/A              | PS OS     | N/A           |
